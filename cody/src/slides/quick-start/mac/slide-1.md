## Mac Install (Step 1 of 3)

1. Download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
2. Open terminal 
3. Type in `node -v`
4. If a version number returns then you are all setup
5. if a bash error like : `-bash: node: command not found` try restarting your computer and install/uninstall node

Node should come pre-installed with NPM, to check if this install worked run the following

1. `npm -v`
2. This should return a version number
