## React Structure

Let's open the folder where we installed the `npm react-create-app`

We Should see a structure like this : 

```
- app
  - node_modules (This is where we install plugins)
  - src
    - app.js (This is the component root of our app)
    - index.js (This is the base of our App)
    - App.css (styling for the app.js)
    - index.css (styling for the index.js)
  - public (This is where images and fonts are stored)
  - package.json (This has build scripts and defines what plugins we are using)
```
Open `App.js`
