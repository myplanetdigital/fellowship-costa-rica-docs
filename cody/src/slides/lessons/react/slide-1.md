## React Explained

So, what is react? In simple terms it is a way of building a serving a Single Page Application. Something to note here, is that react is not a language, it is a framework build in Javascript (Meaning it gets rendered on the client-side). React is a very large and complex libary, but for our purposes we will only be looking at a very small portion of what react is capable of. 

Let's first take a look a the life blood of React, Components. The real purpose of a component can be broken into one thing: Rendering HTML. The web based components are a very powerful tool while building Applications, they allow us to break things into much smalled parts called components and import those parts into a wrapper component. React components have serveral parts, let's have a look at what those are: 

1. Classes
2. Constructor
3. Render
4. Import / Export
