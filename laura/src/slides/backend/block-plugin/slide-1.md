## Create a Block Plugin

A block in Drupal is a type of `Plugin`. 

### Whatâ€™s a Plugin?

A `Plugin` is a reusable piece of code. It can be used in various places in a Drupal project. Plugins are generally represented somehow in the Admin UI as an item that can be manipulated: a widget, a block, a field, etc.

Type `drupal` again in your terminal in the root of your project. You should see a list of available Drupal Console commands.
