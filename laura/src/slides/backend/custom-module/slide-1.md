## Create a Custom Module

Creating custom modules, themes and plugins (like blocks) has gotten very easy since the introduction of Drupal Console. With Drupal console, you can create a basic version of any of many common Drupal elements very easily from the command line. Letâ€™s give it a try!

### Using Drupal Console

Open your terminal and navigate to your project folder.

If you type `drupal` in the command line, you should see a list of all drupal console commands.

Which one do you think you should use to generate a module? Hint: there are descriptions next to the commands. You will use `drupal` followed by the correct command to begin the process.
