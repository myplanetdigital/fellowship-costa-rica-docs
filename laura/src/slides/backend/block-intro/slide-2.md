## Managing Blocks

### Exercise

1. In the Admin UI, go to `Structure > Block layout`. Can you find the `Search` and `Tools` blocks? 

2. Try putting one of them in a different region. 

3. Save blocks at the bottom of the screen and look at the front page again. 

<em>What has changed?</em>

You can see that not only the position of the blocks but the way they look changes depending on which region they appear in. Their appearance is controlled by the CSS in your `theme` (we'll get to that later).

The `regions` you see on the Block page are defined in your theme. When you create a custom theme, you can define the regions any way you want. 

In addition to the standard blocks that come with core Drupal, we can create our own custom blocks. To do this, we need to create a `custom module`.
