## What's a Block?

A block is a box of content that we can place into any area of a page, such as the sidebar region, the header, or the footer. A block can stay in place while the main content of the page changes, and you can control which pages it displays on and who sees it.

The default Drupal configuration comes with two blocks enabled, which you can see in the sidebar: `Search` and `Tools`.

Letâ€™s change the way those blocks are positioned.
