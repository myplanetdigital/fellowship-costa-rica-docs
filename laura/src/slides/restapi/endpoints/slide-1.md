## Create a REST Export display in a view

If you only need view output, creating a REST export in a view is an easy way to create an endpoint. Let's expose that view as a REST Export. 

1.  Go to your Yearbook view of People

2.  Add a REST export display

3. Choose JSON as the serializer format

4. In your field row settings, select Raw Output

5. Provide a path. This will be your endpoint.
