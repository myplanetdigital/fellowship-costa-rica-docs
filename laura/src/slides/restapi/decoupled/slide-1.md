## Introduction to Decoupled

### What is decoupling?

Drupal is a powerful solution for architecting a website. It lets you easily organize data into reusable components and allows you to give a lot of power to content editors to create many different kinds of content and layouts. Drupal also has the power to present the data. 

Nowadays, though, a lot of companies and organizations need to distribute their content across `different channels` including web, mobile, smart TVs, wearables and conversational UIs. And increasingly what they look for in a content management system is the ability for it to act as a single source of truth, so that a content editor can `create once, publish everywhere`.

Developers can use Drupal as the source of truth using Drupal's core `REST API` to create web services.

A fully decoupled website can also be called `headless`. The head refers to the Drupal presentation layer or theme. In the case of a decoupled website, the presentation occurs somewhere else besides Drupal. This is also the meaning of `decoupled`: the front-end is not coupled with the backend, it is on a different platform.

There are also partially or `progressively decoupled` websites, which may feature decoupled components that are rendered within or alongside the 
Drupal theme.
